Ashemon is the reason this blog exsists. Without her insisting, you would not be exposed to my logic paths.

# _Ode to Frank_

Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature,  
An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature;  
Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses  
Contribute to your hunting skills and natural defenses.  


I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations,  
A singular development of cat communications  
That obviates your basic hedonistic predilection  
For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection.  


A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents;  
You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance.  
And when not being utilized to aid in locomotion,  
It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.  


O Frank, the complex levels of behavior you display  
Connote a fairly well-developed cognitive array.  
And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend,  
I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend.
