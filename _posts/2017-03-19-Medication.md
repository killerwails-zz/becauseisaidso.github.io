I am in a cafe.

Listening to First Contact play in the background watching the protest outside whilst I type. They have no call to action. How am I supposed to help? They did not understand. 

Ever close your eyes and go straight to wondering how long you have been asleep? Now try doing homework.

This is the first time that they brought me the coffee from the bar to my seat. BLOOD CELLS! ASSIMILATE! 
Caffine, you and I have a job to do.
